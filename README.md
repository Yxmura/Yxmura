## 💖 About Me

- Student by day, code goblin by night 🌙
- Fluent in Python, React, Next.js, Vite, Tailwind, JS/TS, HTML, CSS, and probably something new tomorrow!
- If my code runs, it's a miracle. If it looks good, that's just Tailwind magic ✨
- I built [renderdragon.org](https://renderdragon.org) because dragons are cool and so am I (source: trust me bro)
- Portfolio: [yamura.dev](https://yamura.dev)
